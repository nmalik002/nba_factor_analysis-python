# NBA Factor Analysis Study
The scope of this project is to classify players based on playing styles and efficiency. The goal is to see where a handful of players fall on this efficiency spectrum based on their styles (off ball, ball dominant, post,etc) This factor analysis can offer some insight on which players could be targeted during free agency.
